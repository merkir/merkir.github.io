The world has vitnessed an upsurge of AI-empowered Finance in the recent years. I am in particular interested in Deep Learning algorithms for stock prediction and profolio creation.

The first part of my exploration started from Fall 2020. As an extension of my class project of <i>Nerual Networks</i> course, I experimented with LSTM and its variation for stock prediction. Specifically, the models that I used includes LSTM, Bidrectional LSTM, LSTM with Attention machenism and Bi-LSTM with Attention, and I ran the models on S&P 500 dataset and Chinese SSE Exchange Index during bear v.s. bull markets.
