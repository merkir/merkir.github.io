@article{CopAndRobber,
  title={Locating Robber with Cop Strategy Graph: Subdivision vs. Multiple Cop},
  author={Shiqi Pan},
  year={2023},
  arxiv={2307.02517},
  abstract={We consider the Robber Locating Game, where an invisible moving robber tries to evade the pursuit of one or more "helicopter" cops, who send distance probes from anywhere on the graph. In this paper, we attempt to propose two useful constructions for general problems in this game: a state variable that describes the available game information for the cops, and a Cop Strategy Graph construction that presents all possibilities of the game given a deterministic cop strategy. Then we will use them, along with algorithms and pseudo-code, to explain the relationship between two graph parameters, the localization number $\zeta$ and the subdivision number $\eta$. Researchers have shown that $\eta=O(\zeta)$ and $\zeta \neq O(\eta)$. We will revisit their proofs, consolidate the essential correspondence between the two numbers via our proposed constructions, and show an explicit result for $\zeta$ in terms of $\eta$, the capture time, and the graph diameter.},
