<a href='#'>Hi, thanks for stopping by! ;)</a>

I'm a **software engineer** in <ins>Equity Trading **@**_Golman Sachs (China)_</ins>. Before that, I have worked for <ins>Global Payments **@**_Bytedance_</ins> and <ins>Payments **@**_Google_</ins>.

Academicly, I am passionate about **AI in Finance** as well as **Complexity Analysis**. For the former, my research focuses on stock perdiction and trading decision with Deep Learning Models; in particular, I am interested in models with practical consideration in business applications such as interpretability, stability and efficiency. For the later, I am interested in the Complexity Analysis of puzzles such as Cop and Robber Game.

I am also an active advocator for **inclusiveness and diversity**. I am a part of the LGBTQ+ Network and the Women's Network at Goldman Sachs. I was also the Event Chair of _Smithies in CS_ to support women at Smith in Computer Science learning.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below.
